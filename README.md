# setter

## TODO
  * add `SkipStepresult`
    * when received by calling Steps, they immediately skip themselves
  * Setter `Runner` as `StepResult` return type
    * could init Steps + `Runner`, then return the runner itself as the result
    * maybe pre-made helper Step to handle passing around pre-made DAGs 

## Wishlist

  * Docker containers as Steps
